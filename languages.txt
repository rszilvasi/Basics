Prefers Java but C family in general

Q: What is your favorite programming language? Why?
A: My favorite programming language right now would 
probably be Python because I've used in the most 
in recent projects and assignments. I used to 
like Java the most but Python has been growing 
on me due to its versatility and uses. 


Q: Is your favorite language the one you are also 
most experienced with? If not, which language 
are you most experienced with?
A: My favorite lanugage is one of the ones I am most 
experienced, as I am roughly the same level in 
both Python and Java.
